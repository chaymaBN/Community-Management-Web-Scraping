       "[\" have to admit i am not a great fan of mcdonalds but it is a great place for a quickish snack, i doubt it can really be classed as a 'fast food establishment' anymore.the one on the champs elysees occupies an ideal position from the company's point of view just a 100 mtrs from the arc de triomphe it is extremely busy, but a large restaurant with an upstairs seating area which means i was coping even at lunchtime.the food was no different to any other mcdonalds i have ever visited and well priced compared with any place to eat near a paris landmark/tourist attraction, we saw coffee on sale near the eifel tower at 16 euros per cup, were charge 22 euros for a cup of tea, small beer and small bottle of water more than half a mile from the tower so that in itself is a major point.ordering is almost totally be card/automatic ordering machine which i personally find a little difficult to understand but would be child's play to most regular uses and there does seem to be ample machines within the takeaway/café, i can't bring myself to call it a restaurant.i found my fillet of fish and fries as always never seem to fill me up and i am by no means a big eater.there is a nice covered area on the pavement outside which must be nice to use in the summer and ok even in february.it is what it it and what it claims to be, nothing better nothing worse, great for mcdonalds fans and there are millions of them the friends with us love them and were actively looking for one.  \",\n",
       " ' food was fine. staff were undesirably rude!family outing completely ruined by rude, disrespectful, unpleasant manavoid!!!!!!!!  ',\n",
       " ' we went here to enjoy the golden arches fries. easy to use touch screen ordering. but wish they had cleaning wipes to wash the screens. i sure don’t like the idea of putting my hands on that screen before eating. then you have pay to use the bathroom. wasn’t mcdonalds finest day  ',\n",
       " ' when i visited this mcdonalds i was excited to see so many options that we don’t have on the menu in ireland. however my bacon and blue cheese burger and fries were served barely warm (cheese wasn’t even slightly melted and the bun and the burger were both very dry. also queued 15 minutes to use the toilet as there was only one stall in operation, the others were filthy and blocked. considering the prices are so high compared to other mcdonalds they need to do better. i would not return.  ',\n",
       " ' this restaurent was a mad uprade from the one back in the united kingdom. my travel to france was fancy and made even more fancy when i ventured into this chain. the smell of wine and cheese was not prevelent. i instead smelt burgers and sweaty bodies that were pile driving into this chain. that is what i love after all. btw if you need any flowers hit me up.this is stop 2 of 195  ',\n",
       " \" the wait for the women's toilet was 15mins. when we finally got in we saw that no one wanted to pay for the toilet so even though there were four stalls only two were in use as people would grab the door in order to not pay. the state of those toilets was disgusting. trash piled almost waste high and no toilet paper. we paid to use the other toilets and then after ordering found out we could have gotten a token to use the toilet for free. geez. the ordering process was smooth as everyone used one of the many kiosks to order. food came very quickly. after ordering we waited about two minutes for our order to come out. the food tastes the same as in the us.  \",\n",
       " ' do you know how they call double bigmac in france? - royal cheese!good stuff, best burgers in paris  ',\n",
       " ' for a busy location service was fast and friendly and food was well prepared. we really enjoyed the mac experience in paris.  ',\n",

       " \" have to admit i am not a great fan of mcdonalds but it is a great place for a quickish snack, i doubt it can really be classed as a 'fast food establishment' anymore.the one on the champs elysees occupies an ideal position from the company's point of view just a 100 mtrs from the arc de triomphe it is extremely busy, but a large restaurant with an upstairs seating area which means i was coping even at lunchtime.the food was no different to any other mcdonalds i have ever visited and well priced compared with any place to eat near a paris landmark/tourist attraction, we saw coffee on sale near the eifel tower at 16 euros per cup, were charge 22 euros for a cup of tea, small beer and small bottle of water more than half a mile from the tower so that in itself is a major point.ordering is almost totally be card/automatic ordering machine which i personally find a little difficult to understand but would be child's play to most regular uses and there does seem to be ample machines within the takeaway/café, i can't bring myself to call it a restaurant.i found my fillet of fish and fries as always never seem to fill me up and i am by no means a big eater.there is a nice covered area on the pavement outside which must be nice to use in the summer and ok even in february.it is what it it and what it claims to be, nothing better nothing worse, great for mcdonalds fans and there are millions of them the friends with us love them and were actively looking for one.  \",\n",

Mais on ne peut pas dire que la réputation de MacDo est très positive puisque on peut constater une certaine opposition et meme contradiction puisque les deux plus grandes portions des avis sont 4 étoiles (132 avis) et 1 étoile (124 avis). Donc on peut dire que l'image est soit très positive pour une portions des clients et soit très négative pour d'autres clients."

But, all in all it was convenient for me since I passed through the station very often late in the evening and so it was handy to just drop in and grab a bite to eat. Funny thing here is that all the chairs and tables are screwed down to the floor! Wasn't like that when they first opened here.

They do not have kiosk from which you can place your order as do the McDonalds so you have to wait in line to place your order and sometimes this place gets really busy! But, all in all it was convenient for me since I passed through the station very often late in the evening and so it was handy to just drop in and grab a bite to eat. Funny thing here is that all the chairs and tables are screwed down to the floor! Wasn't like that when they first opened here. The food is good, for a fast food joint, but not many of the employees speak English but then it is France! Bon appetite!\n",
